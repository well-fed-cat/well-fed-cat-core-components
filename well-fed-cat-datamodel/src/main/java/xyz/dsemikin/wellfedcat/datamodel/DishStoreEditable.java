/**
 * <p>
 *     Any implementation should respect these additional requirements described below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     If the dish with particular public id and name was deleted, it
 *     should be possible to use them again (independently) for other
 *     dishes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Same is valid, if dish name or public id was changed, - the old
 *     value is allowed to be reused by other dishes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Note: Possibility to change and reuse public ids and names
 *     means, that the system does not enforce validity
 *     of external references to the dishes. If public ID was saved
 *     outside the system and then was used to retrieve the dish,
 *     it is not guaranteed, that the dish will be the same or will
 *     exist at all.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     To enforce it we would need to include "constant-quasi-unique-id",
 *     (one could call it "strong-id") which would be generated
 *     in such a way, that it is quasi-globally-unique
 *     (e.g. UUID) and it is not allowed to be reused ever.

 * <h3>Interaction with {@code MenuTimelineStore}</h3>
 * <p>
 *     Even though {@code DishStoreEditable} does not explicitly refer to
 *     {@link MenuTimelineStore} or {@link MenuTimelineStoreEditable}, their
 *     behavior together should be explicitly specified to ensure consistent
 *     behavior of different implementations of these stores.
 *
 *     See documentation for {@link MenuTimelineStoreEditable} for additional
 *     constraints interaction of this class with {@link MenuTimelineStore}
 *     and {@link MenuTimelineStoreEditable}.

 * <h2>Stores with "staging" and without it</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 *     More thoughts about staging are available here:
 *     <a href="https://well-fed-cat.github.io/2021/09/20/Concurrent-acess-and-staging-problem-for-stores.html">
 *     Concurrent Access And Staging Problem For Stores
 *     </a>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Current implementation will assume "staging" is present, i.e. the Dish objects
 *     are not directly connected to the DB. Instead copy of the data from DB is
 *     created. The object may be modified and then updated version can be stored
 *     again to the DB.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     To handle concurrent access we will introduce versioning of the objects and
 *     will prohibit update, if the other update happened since this object was created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Another problem of staging is, hat we need to
